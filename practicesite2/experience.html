		<p>I have been home with my children since the birth of my daughter in 2008. Much of my work experience is from the years prior to that.</p>
		<p>I have been in college at George Mason University since 2000, working towards a <strong>Bachelors Degree in Individualized Study in Strategic Communications &amp; Information Design</strong>.</p>
		<p>While working on my degree I have been able to work as an intern at nonprofit organizations in my local area.</p>
		<p>Much of my previous work experience was with small businesses that were managed by their owners. Due to the smaller nature of these companies, I was able to work in many areas and get experience doing things outside of what my title might suggest.</p>
		<p>While staying home, I have also spent many hours volunteering with organizations in my local area. This work has led me to pursue a career in the nonprofit area.</p>
