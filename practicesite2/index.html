	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>With experience in marketing, web design, and administrative roles, I bring a wealth of expertise in creating impactful marketing materials, managing online platforms, and supporting organizational operations. From my time as a <em>Marketing Assistant</em> at the Illinois Natural History Survey to leading web design projects at Hobbico, I've honed my skills in managing digital content, crafting compelling copy, and collaborating with diverse teams to drive innovative marketing strategies. My background also includes extensive experience in volunteer positions, such as serving as a <em>Troop Co&ndash;Leader</em> for the Girl Scouts, where I developed strong leadership and organizational skills. Currently pursuing a <b>Bachelors degree in Interdisciplinary Studies</b> with a focus on Strategic Communication &amp; Information Design, I am eager to leverage my multifaceted skill set and passion for nonprofit work to make a meaningful impact in the community.</p>
