	  <h1>Hi, I'm Micki.</h1>
	  <p class="basictext">I'm all about strategic communication and information design, pursuing a BIS degree with a perfect GPA at George Mason University (graduating in 2025, fingers crossed!).</p>
	<p class="basictext">My passion lies in writing, editing, and designing across various platforms&#8212;whether it&#39;s crafting engaging web copy, stirring up social media buzz, or creating marketing pieces. My journey has taken me through internships and roles like Marketing Assistant at the Illinois Natural History Survey, where I honed my skills in project management, pulbic relations, and nonprofit sector know-how.</p>
	<p class="basictext">Outside of academics and work, I've been deeply involved with the Girl Scouts of Our Nationâ€™s Capital, serving as a Troop Co-Leader and boosting sales by over $15,000 during my tenure as Service Unit Fall Product Manager. It's been incredibly rewarding to blend my skills in communication, teamwork, and volunteer management to support such a meaningful cause.</p>
	<p class="basictext">When I&#39;m not glued to my laptop (which, let's be honest, isn't often!), you might find me at a concert, singing karaoke, or at the community theatre acting onstage, viewing from the audience or creating award&#8211;winning costumes backstage. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickalei-lindquist/">LinkedIn</a> or check out some of my work on my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>&#8212;I&#39;m always up for discussing new opportunities or just chatting about all things communication and design!</p>
